# Architectural Overview

Indoctrinate is built to catalog and addressible set of content, building metadata (e.g. name, tag, ingest date/time, source) based on content material and location.

Because we are scanning a known location, very few of the complex descriptors need to be passed at runtime.  They can be addressed using well-formed content tag filter sets.
